# Slim Framework 4 Skeleton Application

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton?branch=master)

Use this skeleton application to quickly setup and start working on a new Slim Framework 4 application. This application uses the latest Slim 4 with Slim PSR-7 implementation and PHP-DI container implementation. It also uses the Monolog logger.

This skeleton application was built for Composer. This makes setting up a new Slim Framework application quick and easy.

## Install the Application
To run the application in development, you can run these commands 

```bash
composer start
```

Or you can use `docker-compose` to run the app with `docker`, so you can run these commands:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

```bash
docker exec -it shopmiddleware-slim-1 sh
```
## Rin this:
### Open `http://localhost:8080/import-products` in Postman, And add JSON payload of products.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
